Before this starting this lab, you should have learnt about:

- Python Programming
- Introduction to Pandas DataFrames and Series
- Data Cleaning: handling null values and duplicates
- Data Formatting: dealing with strings, dates, renaming columns, using map, apply and mapapply methods
- Data structuring and combining data: methods such as pivot, stack/unstack or melt for data structuring and merge, concat or join for combining data.
- Data Aggregation: groupby and aggregation functions

## Introduction

Welcome to the data aggregation and filtering lab! In this lab, you will practice how to apply various aggregation functions and filter data to obtain insights, identify patterns, and derive meaningful conclusions from your data. 

Aggregation is a powerful technique that allows you to group your data by one or more variables and calculate summary statistics for each group. This is especially useful when working with large datasets, as it can help you to understand the overall structure of your data and identify trends and patterns that might not be immediately apparent.

During this lab, you will work with a variety of datasets and practice how to use common aggregation functions such as sum, count, mean, median, min, and max. You will also practice how to group your data by one or more variables and how to apply these aggregation functions to obtain insights and draw meaningful conclusions from your data. Also, you will practice data filtering a bit more. By the end of this lab, you will have a strong understanding of how aggregation works and how it can be used to analyze data in a variety of contexts. So let's get started!

**Happy coding!** :heart:


## Important Notes

This lab is built on top of the `data cleaning and formatting` and `data structuring and combining` lab. If you couldn't complete those lasb, ask your TA for the lab solutions so you can do this lab on top of it.

## Requirements

- Fork this repo
- Clone it to your machine

## Getting Started

Complete the challenges in the `Jupyter Notebook` file. Follow the instructions and add your code and explanations as necessary.

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Solved lab"
git push origin master
```

- Create a Pull Request so that your TAs can check your work.
